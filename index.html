          strengths and weaknesses, which is essential knowledge when it comes
          to a Pokémon battle. Also you will learn what stats are, which stats
          exist and how every stat works. To maximize them, you will be able to
          read, what EV and DV stand for and how to increase them. Also Pokémon
          natures will be explained and it is shown how to change them if
          necessary. You will be introduced to Pokémon abilities, hidden
          abilities and how to decide, which ability your Pokémon will have.
          Also you will find out, what items are in Pokémon battles and why the
          correct item pick is crucial to succeed in PvP online battles.
          Finally, the new feature "Tera Type" will be introduced. You will find
          out, what this type stands for and how to use it properly. <br />
          In the next section of this website, you will find the latest tier
          list for online battles. Here you will find out, which Pokémon are
          currently the best when competing against real players. Additionally
          the current ban list is attached to make sure not to use prohibited
          Pokémon online. <br />
          If this is your first contact with Pokémon online battles, you will
          love the third section of this website, which shows you a training
          example. You will learn how to get your first Pokémon ready for PvP
          battles. Therefore, a checklist is provided to optimize your Pokémon
          step by step. In our training example, you will see an in-depth guide
          for training a physical attacking Dragonite perfectly. <br />
          Finally I will introduce myself briefly. Thank you for visiting my

          <article id="scarlet-article">
            Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are the first open-world RPGs in
            the Pokémon series. As you enjoy the hallmarks of the
            series—meeting, teaming up with, battling, training, and trading
            Pokémon—you'll be able to immerse yourself in a newly evolved
            adventure. To compete in totally new and actual online battles which
            are constantly evolving and being updated, you need to own a
            Nintendo Switch and at least one of both Pokémon Scarlet or Violet.
            These games were released on November 18 in 2022. <br />
            In Pokémon Scarlet, your professor is Professor Sada, in Pokémon
            Violet, it's Professor Turo. For the first time in a new Pokémon
            generation, the two versions of the game have version-exclusive
            profs. The two different professors tie in to the thematic
            differences between the games. <br />
            Pokémon Scarlet generally embodies the past, whilst Violet embodies
            the future. This is true of several different aesthetics in the
            games. The version-exclusive legendaries, for example, and their
            vehicular transformations. Koraidon, exclusive to Scarlet, uses its
            legs and wheels to drive around, whereas Miraidon is a kind of jet
            bike. You'll see similar differences when riding them on the water
            and while flying around Paldea's expansive map.

          <article id="violet-article">
            The Pokémon school in Mesagoza is named “Naranja Academy” in Scarlet
            and “Uva Academy” in Violet. The badges are different in both games,
            too, which brings us to the final differences between the games.
            You'll notice all the little motifs are subtly different in both
            versions. School uniform is red in Scarlet and, er, violet in
            Violet. <br />
            You'll notice similar changes throughout both games on various
            characters and items, including the Scarlet and Violet Book.
            Additionally, each Pokémon game will contain exclusive Pokémon which
            the opposite edition doesn't provide. You can still obtain them by
            trading with trainers of the other edition. <br />
            For example, in Pokémon Scarlet you will be able to catch Koraidon,
            Armarogue, Larvitar and its evolved forms, Stonjourner and Great
            Tusk. Respectively, in Pokémon Violet you will be able to catch
            Pokémon like Miraidon, Ceruledge, Bagon and its evolved forms,
            Eiscue and Iron Treads exclusively.

        <article id="str-wea-article">
          All Pokémon creatures and their moves are assigned certain types. Each
          type has several strengths and weaknesses in both attack and defense.
          In battle, you should use Pokémon and moves that have a type advantage
          over your opponent; doing so will cause much more damage than normal.
          <br />
          A single-type advantage (for instance a Water attack against a
          Ground-type Pokémon) will net you double normal damage. The advantages
          also stack up, so a double-type advantage (for instance a Water attack
          against a Ground/Rock-type Pokémon) will net you quadruple damage. In
          both these cases you will see the message It's super effective!
          in-game after the attack. <br />
          Conversely, a single- and double-type disadvantage will afflict half
          and a quarter normal damage respectively. Here you will see the
          message It's not very effective... in-game. <br />
          Another advantage you can gain is Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB). As
          the name implies, this increases the power of the move if the
          attacking Pokémon has the same type as the move used (for example a
          Fire-type Pokémon using a Fire-type move). In this case the damage is
          1.5 times normal. Again this is added to any other advantages, so a
          Water-type Pokémon using a Water-type move against a Ground/Rock-type
          Pokémon will bag you six times (2 times 2 times 1.5) normal damage!
          <br />
          <br />
          On the right hand side you will find the current strengths and
          weaknesses chart.

          />
          Stats determine, how "strong" or "weak" a Pokémon is in battle. Each
          Pokémon has six stats, which are all working in a different way. Every
          Pokémon has a base value for each stat. Stats can be increased by
          leveling, allocating EV and increacing DV. Here you which stats do
          exist and how they are working:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>HP:</b> Stands for "Health Points". The more HP a Pokémon has,
              the longer it tends to survice. A Pokémon is defeated when
              reaching 0 HP.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ATK:</b> Stands for "Attack". Affects how much damage physical
              attacks will inflict to your opponent. The higher the ATK value of
              a Pokémon, the more physical damage it will deal to your opponent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DEF:</b> Stands for "Defense". Affects how much damage your
              Pokémon will mitigate when receiving a physical attack. The more
              DEF your Pokémon has, the less physical damage it will receicve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>SpATK:</b> Stands for "Special Attack". Analogue to ATK, but
              with respect to special, not physical, attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>SpDEF:</b> Stands for "Special Defense". Analogue to DEF, but
              with respect to special, not physical, attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>SPD:</b> Stands for "Speed". The Pokémon with the higher SPD
              stat attacks first. Priority Attacks will still executed first, no
              matter how high the SPD value of a Pokémon is.

          <article id="ev-article">
            "EV" stands for "Efford Values". Every Pokémon can obtain 510 EV.
            This can happen either by fighting other Pokémon in PvE battles or
            by giving your Pokémon "Feathers" or "Vitamins". Each Pokémon can
            obtain a maximum of 255 EV per stat. Every 4 EV will increase the
            value of a certain stat by 1 point. Therefore to maximize the value
            of your EV, allocate 252 EV on two stats and 4 EV on another stat
            regilarly. 2 EV will remain useless. You can see an abstract
            overview of you EV on the interface on the left hand side.

          <article id="dv-article">
            "DV" stands for "Deter Values". As the name suggests, DV are
            determined when catching a Pokémon randomly in general. Several
            Pokémon, e.g. Pokémon you find in Tera Raids or legendary Pokémon,
            have some maximized DV per default when catching them. DV can't be
            changed, except you use "Gold Bottle Caps" or "Silver Bottle Caps"
            to maximize the stats of your choice. DV can be described by a value
            between 0 and 31. DV can be observed by using your Pokémon Box and
            examining the evaluation of your Pokémon. Therefore, several terms
            are used:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Best:</b> 31</li>
              <li><b>Fantastic:</b> 30</li>

          Every Pokémon has a special nature per default. While a Pokémon nature
          increases the value of one stat by 10%, another stats will be

          "Bashful", "Quirky" and "Serious", which will have no impact on the
          stats of a Pokémon. HP cannot be affected by the nature of a Pokémon.

          An ability is a game mechanic introduced in Generation III that

          an Ability could not be changed after a Pokémon was obtained except by
          evolution—where the new Ability is determined by the former
          Ability—and form change. Not every Ability is entirely beneficial;
          some of them are hindering. Most Pokémon are able to learn a hidden

          including healing, powering up, helping one to catch Pokémon, or
          accessing new areas. When it comes to competitive PvP battles, each

          Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, like most other games in the Pokémon
          series, has a new gimmick that changes up how Pokémon work. We've been
          through Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, Dynamax Pokémon, and now we have
          Terastallization — a crystal-like addition to a Pokémon's appearance
          that has the power to change their type. But how does the Pokémon's
          Tera Type change their moves? Does it change their STAB stats? Does it
          protect those Pokémon from their weaknesses? <br />
          To put it simply: A Tera Type will replace that Pokémon's offensive
          typing, but add to its types defensively. Basically, Terastallization
          makes most sense as a defensive strategy in most cases. Let's use an
          example. The Flying Tera Type Pikachu that you'll be able to get as an
          early purchase bonus is a great start. Pikachu's normal typing is
          Electric. Electric types moves are super effective against Water and
          Flying, not very effective against Electric, Grass, and Dragon and
          they do no damage to Ground-type Pokémon. However, once you
          Terastallize into Flying type, that changes Pikachu to Flying type.
          Flying types are strong against Grass, Fighting, and Bug and weak to
          Electric, Rock, and Steel. This Pikachu still cannot use Electric
          moves against a ground Pokémon, but it is now no longer weak to Grass
          and Dragon types. Flying Pikachu will also now have a Same-Type Attack
          Bonus for Flying moves, but will not lose its Same-Type Attack Bonus
          for Electric moves. <br />
          You are able to terastallize a Pokémon once per battle.
